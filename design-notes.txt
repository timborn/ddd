----------------------------
Using any competent browser, a user should be able to open host:port (where port is typically 69xx)
and be presented with NoVNC password prompt.  Getting past that presents a full Linux desktop
with all necessary developer tools for Java development preinstalled and configured.

These are disposable containers so use of git for persistance of code changes is essential.

The user will run as a generic user (user2) with access to sudo, should that be necessary.

The entrypoint for all this are the last lines of the Dockerfile, which executes

	ENTRYPOINT ["/dockerstartup/vnc_startup.sh"]
	CMD ["--tail-log"]

... which you can see when you watch the logs for the container.

Dockerfile 
	--> vnc_startup.sh

		--> /headless/noVNC/utils/launch.sh \	# start NoVNC
		    --vnc localhost:$VNC_PORT \
		    --listen $NO_VNC_PORT &
		--> vncserver $DISPLAY \		# start VNC
		    -depth $VNC_COL_DEPTH \
		    -geometry $VNC_RESOLUTION \
                    -xstartup $HOME/scripts/xstartup
		--> $HOME/wm_startup.sh			# starts xfce

NB vncserver will generate $HOME/.vnc/xstartup, but for some reason the generated version included
a line to kill off the process just started, so we inject our own xstartup and explicitly use it.

If VNC_PW is passed into the container when it starts, vncpasswd will be changed accordingly.
